This is a school assignment I was given. I had to build a website where the user must guess a secret number between 1 and 100 and has only 7 chances to do so. 

# How to run the code
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/PizzaPiee/guess-the-number.git`
2. Run the following commands: 
```
npm install
npm run serve
```
The website is also hosted [here](https://eachviolentparentheses.mazino99.repl.co/).
